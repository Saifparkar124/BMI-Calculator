# BMI CAlculator

A BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator is a tool used to estimate an individual's body fat based on their height and weight. Here's a basic description of how it works:

1. **Input**: Users provide their height and weight as input to the calculator. Height is typically measured in meters or feet/inches, while weight is usually measured in kilograms or pounds.

2. **Calculation**: The BMI is calculated using the formula:

   BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m) * height (m))

   Alternatively, for users providing height in feet and inches:

   BMI = (weight (lbs) / (height (in) * height (in))) * 703

3. **Output**: The calculated BMI value is then displayed to the user. This value is a numerical indicator of body fatness, categorized into different ranges:

   - Underweight: BMI < 18.5
   - Normal weight: 18.5 ≤ BMI < 25
   - Overweight: 25 ≤ BMI < 30
   - Obesity: BMI ≥ 30

4. **Interpretation**: Users can interpret their BMI value to assess their body fat level and understand if they are within a healthy weight range or if they may be underweight, overweight, or obese.

5. **Additional Information**: Some BMI calculators may also provide additional information or recommendations based on the calculated BMI, such as advice on maintaining a healthy weight, suggestions for diet and exercise, or referrals to healthcare professionals for further evaluation and guidance.

Overall, a BMI calculator provides a quick and easy way for individuals to assess their body fat level and make informed decisions about their health and lifestyle.
